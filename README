# If the above fails you can try the steps manually as shown below
#-----------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	
# First make sure you have pip installed, for example in Ubuntu
sudo easy_install pip

# Also make sure that git is installed, for example in Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install git-core

# Go to your favorite directory and clone the project
git clone https://ingenieroariel@github.com/ingenieroariel/gs-science.git

# Alternatively, for r/w access using SSH public keys, the command is
git clone git@github.com:ingenieroariel/gs-science.git

# Navigate to the newly created server
cd gs-science

# Then install the python dependencies, for example in Ubuntu
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

# For those not used to git, here is a quick and dirty manual:
# To make sure your sources are up to date, type:
git pull

# To see a local diff:
git diff

# To commit changes use this one: (-a means add all the file that have changed)
git commit -a -m "this is what I am doing"

# To put the changes back online
git push origin master
